# 2021 Summer Tech Classes 

## Video Game Programming in Unity

1. The goal of the class is to give you experience in game design using c#, visual studio, and unity game development environment. At the end of the class, you can make any game your mind desires!
2. This is a 6 session remote class. Each session is one and half hours long. Meet once a week starting 7/6 week. Every Tuesday 10:30am
3. No prerequisites needed, feel free to ask any questions about programming, I will share all my code for everyone on GitHub. There is no need to follow along with the unity process, so if you aren't big into the programming aspect of the game, staying for game design inspiration would be fine! Ask me anything about the game industry in general.
